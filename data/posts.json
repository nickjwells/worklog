Essentially, based on health markers, I \"saved\" around half a year.\n\nSome broader wins and self-discoveries:\n- Took an overnight trip to Edmonton to see some family and friends. While sleep has suffered the last two nights, I still crushed the routine.\n- Feel my bar for perfectionism lowering again. This is big and one of my low-hanging fruits for this year. Even 90% Nick is, like, 400% the information density of the average content you find on the internet. \n- Shows me I can sustain the routine even in suboptimal situations.\n- Have been extremely happy. I believe this is (of course) because of the daily exercise, but also smaller things like daily sunlight exposure, daily walks to/from gym, etc. Making iterative progress in my health is clearly extremely important to me.\n\nAdditionally, I have been *more* productive with the rest of my career. I have found that some activities drain energy, but others improve energy. My routine actually counterintuitively increases my capacity for work.\n\nOnto another two weeks!",

Cliff notes:\n\n1. Massive development. MCP ease-of-use is the primary advantage to it over other frameworks (Skills, DOE). But context rot is the main drawback. This solves context rot, makes tools like 5x as token efficient at the cost of an additional lookup step. You can now load Claude Code, use something like mcpmarket.com/leaderboards to slap on a half dozen MCPs in ~10 mins, and have a fully fledged operating system (that actually works).  \n2. Anthropic, Google, OpenAI are all experimenting with designing on-the-fly interfaces. Because a picture is worth a thousand words; bandwidth wise, you can transmit an incredible amount more information visually than textually. And as you see with Claude Code, these things are fantastic at frontend. You can oneshot most big apps with just a screenshot tool, HTML, and some Tailwind CSS. What if, instead of communicating via a little chat window in an IDE, it spun up whole frontends for you? This is the future of automation: AI will spin up beautiful, sexy interfaces every time you prompt it.\n3. Biggest issue right now is just context. Google inherently has access to everything a personal intelligence would ever need, solving the context problem. If they don't fuck up their UX, like they've done with a bunch of other launches, this would be quite the killer app.\n\nProduction workflow: #1 is obviously the biggest development. So I'd come up with some hook, say it, then take each of these and then run with them. I'd probably get ~5min ad-libbing on each topic. OBS, Auphonic for audio enhancements, instant upload. Over time, come up with semi-automated workflows to make the video more interesting where necessary.\n\nOnly issue is thumbnails. Do I just patent some sort of super stand-out-ey background + take a screenshot of a logo or whatever? I could build a few templates in Canva and then cycle them, I suppose. One with me talking about a thing (face) with text on the left, another with just app logos in the middle, another with app logos on the right and some text on the left, another with my face on the right and app logos on the left and perhaps some question marks or whatever. I think this is reasonable. I'll use my real face, too, since people are getting tired of the AI stuff.\n\nOkay, I think this is it! End result would be similar to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLe2ghr6Oug, just punchier and more interesting. All that is left for me is to act. I bet I could bang out >300 of these this year.",

      "content": "How should I create content? \n\nFor the last week, I've done bespoke videos for Maker School. They've been between 15 to 30 minutes long, and answered questions that I've found valuable in the community. \n\nReception has been great, and this practice has gotten my proverbial wheels rolling again. I also do them all in one take (low production quality) with a whiteboard.\n\nHowever, my YouTube needs content too. The ideation process in Maker School is quite easy—I just scroll through the posts and find one that I consider interesting. Can I do the same thing for YouTube?\n\nA preliminary example of this might involve me scrolling through X or LinkedIn. And then finding, say, 3 developments/posts that I find interesting. I use one for the packaging (e.g \"Claude Cowork\"), write a reasonably sexy title \"Claude Cowork: Now Coworking You Out Of Business\" etc, and talk about that subject first. Afterwards, I cover the two others. Whiteboard when necessary, etc.\n\nThe biggest thing, I feel, would be to simply quell that voice in my head that says the content sucks. Weirdly, it seems like I consider the content in Maker School to be inherently okay, since within my group I'm the end-all, be-all authority, and I suppose I'm used to the idea that they enjoy content off-the-cuff. But on YouTube, I internally believe the bar is higher or something, because I commonly don't want to publish content unless it's super polished. So I need to overcome this.\n\nI suppose that's just the perfectionism I've always struggled with. I can beat this no differently to how I've beaten the rest (basically, just publishing shit anyway even if I feel it sucks).\n\nI will of course spend a moment to think about what I want to say before saying it. Think MoistCritical-style intros. But I believe this is feasible.\n\nWhat's more, I could weave that directly into my Maker School stuff. I could do the Maker School uploads first, as a warm-up, since I consider the bar lower. After I feel good, I could upload it as a community exclusive, and while it's uploading, record the YouTube video. Would be a good batch use of time as well.\n\nOkay, I think I'll do this. Next is just me figuring out a content curation method that effectively finds three high-quality, interesting developments to comment on.\n\nI'll try X first.",

Yesterday I was probably the happiest I'd been in ~2 months. \n\nI really do need some form of daily, progressive overload to feel satisfied. Though it eventually got tiresome, my Daily Updates were extremely helpful in that regard.\n\nThings to change in the routine:\n- I'm persistently forgetting to do my Anki. I must find a way to conceptually tie this to me physically entering the gym.\n- The content I'm recording for Maker School is good. Very Daily-Update-esque. People like it and I'm improving my ability to talk about content again. This is clearly my zone of competence. I should do something very similar for my YouTube channel and just post. After ~1-2wks I'm confident I'll pick up some steam, and as long as I find a bank of content to draw from I think I can easily outperform anyone on YouTube (given the fact that I am more articulate and more interesting).\n- I need to stop having Poke bowls right after the gym. I love those things, and it's great protein-wise, but the high sodium goes against my current goals.\n\nI'll think more about this. But yeah, 8 days in a row of gym + actionables has me feeling great. I wonder how I'll feel at 80 days!",

Aqua -&gt; Claude Code saves a lot of time and keeps hands off the keyboard\n\nContext7 is the meta-mcp which makes all other API docs possible. Instead of using MCP and storing them in your context window (massive token drain and makes perf worse), just use Context7 and then look up API docs\n\nhttps://t.co/u3I0ZLcKf5 should be minimal since it's attaching to every instantiation. This has worked ok for me https://t.co/TzLAymH9Z2\n\nAlso, since Claude Code for agency contexts (basically using it as my agent to take tasks) doesn't really work on the current repo a ton, you can just run multiple claude code instances w/o worktrees or any magic like that. Just fire up 3 and run them constantly\n\nClaude often creates files in the current working directory but doesn't remove them after work is done. To eliminate bloat, add a line like \"if you need to create temporary files/etc during task execution, do so in a /temp folder to keep things organized unless otherwise asked\"",
